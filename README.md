Description, design and example implementation 
by Harold Fortuin, Principal, Fortuitous Consulting Services, Inc.:

I propose a modern OO language update of the Parameterized Factory Creational
Pattern [Gamma95]. It is compact since it folds the Factory method into an abstract
base class, and imposes a package structure on its concrete subclasses. The design is
demonstrated in Java, but is also applicable to C# and other modern object-oriented
languages.
